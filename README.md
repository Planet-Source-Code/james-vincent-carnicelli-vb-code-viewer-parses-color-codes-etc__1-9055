### Description

This is an old utility I made a few years ago in VB 5. It can display the main project files in a .VBP and display the contents and a summary of what's in its code modules, color-coded.

<P><P>It was designed to let any VB project be a reference for itself. To that end, it picks out any comments that appear immediately before a subroutine or function. And since its output is a RichEdit control, you can copy and paste anything it outputs into Word or some other editor for instant documentation.

<P><P>While it's probably lacking a few reserved keywords and might be a little out of date, it's got a valuable core of logic to parse VB code and an algorithm to color-code VB stuff for a RichEdit control.

<P><P>I welcome comments and improvements, so long as you give credit where it's due. Please vote for this code if you find it useful.
